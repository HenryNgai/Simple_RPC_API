# Using Application
```
```

# Todo - My notes
- [ ] Implement service using gRPC (protobuf)
- [ ] Handle incoming requests from Simple_REST_API
- [ ] Incorporate database utilization (SqLite for rapid dev?)

# More Todo - After REST API
- [ ] Graphql API (different repo maybe)
- [ ] Additional NoSQL database for a service?
